from django.conf.urls import url, include
from django.contrib import admin

urlpatterns = [
	url(r'^$', schema_view),

	url(r'^accounts/', include('accounts.urls')),

'''
	Note that the regular expressions for the include() function doesn't have a $(end-of-string match character) 
	but rather a trailing slash. Whenever Django encounters include(), it chops off whatevre part of the URL matched 
	up to that point and sends the remaining string to the included URLconf for further processing.
